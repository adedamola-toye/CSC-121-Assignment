# Exercise 3.17 - Mortgage Calculator
   Develop a C program to calculate the interest accrued on a bank customer's mortgage. For each customer, the following facts are available:
a) the account number
b) the mortgage amount
c) the mortgage term
d) the interest rate
The program should input each fact, calculate the total interest payable ( = mortgage amount
× interest rate × mortgage term), and add it to the mortgage amount to get the total amount payable.
It should calculate the required monthly payment by dividing the total amount payable by the
number of months in the mortgage term. The program should display the required monthly payment rounded off to the nearest dollar. The program should process each customer's account at a
time.

# Exercise 3.18 - Sales Commission Calculator
One large chemical company pays its salespeople on a commission basis. The salespeople receive $200 per week plus 9% of their gross sales for that week. For
example, a salesperson who sells $5000 worth of chemicals in a week receives $200 plus 9% of
$5000, or a total of $650. Develop a program that will input each salesperson’s gross sales for last
week and will calculate and display that salesperson’s earnings. Process one salesperson's figures at a
time. 


# Exercise 3.19 - Interest Calculator
The simple interest on a loan is calculated by the formula
interest = principal * rate * days / 365;
The preceding formula assumes that rate is the annual interest rate, and therefore includes the
division by 365 (days). Develop a program that will input principal, rate and days for several
loans, and will calculate and display the simple interest for each loan, using the preceding formula.


# Exercise 3.20 - Salary Calculator
Develop a program that will determine the gross pay for each of several
employees. The company pays “straight time” for the first 40 hours worked by each employee and
pays “time-and-a-half” for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours. You’re given a list of the employees of the company, the number of hours each employee worked last week and the hourly rate of
each employee. Your program should input this information for each employee and should determine and display the employee's gross pay.
